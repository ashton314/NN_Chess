You will need a copy of MIT-Scheme on your system. Make sure that it
is executable on the command line as `mit-scheme'. If the command is
different, you'll need to change every instance of "mit-scheme" in the
Makefile to whatever your scheme implementation is.

Once that is done, run the following command:
  make play

This will automatically run the `make install' command.

Occasionally, MIT-Scheme will not start properly (at least on OS X
Mountain Lion). The error message I have been getting looks something
like this:

mit-scheme: can't find a readable default for option --band.
        searched for file all.com in these directories:
        /Applications/Scheme.app/Contents/Resources
        /usr/local/lib/mit-scheme-x86-64

Inconsistency detected.

Just run the `make install' command until you don't get this error
message any more. This error comes occasionally, but I have never had
to try more than twice to get the program to compile properly.
