You will need a copy of MIT-Scheme on your system. Make sure that it
is executable on the command line as `mit-scheme'. If the command is
different, you'll need to change every instance of "mit-scheme" in the
Makefile to whatever your scheme implementation is.

Once that is done, run the following commands:
  make clean
  make compile
