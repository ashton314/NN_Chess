This is to help me keep track of the project, and so that I don't have
to clutter up the git commit with these longer entries.

Today I'm working on implementing the backprop algorithm. I'm using
that PDF series I found. Once I get that working I'll write some tests
using the examples in the PDF.

Finished writing a crude back propogation algorithm! The interface is
very messy, but it passed the tests. Now that I've got the very basics
of the network working, I'll try my network model out on some more
complicated examples, and test doing "real" learning with it. For fun,
I could teach it to play tic-tac-toe.

I'm wanting to rewrite the network simulator. The model I've got right
now is kinda messy and probably fairly inefficent. I think I'll try
writing another closure-based network system, but this time do it
better.

Eventually, I'd like to write the network with closures that compile
into some nice, fast code. I might wait to do this until after I've
got other elements of this project working, such as the chess engine
and the Negascout framework.
