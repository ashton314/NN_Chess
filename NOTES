* Neural networks
** General information
   - Best if you have some domain knowledge (e.g. the king is in
     check, etc.)
   - Testing toy neural network: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/
   - Try 2x the #of input nodes for # hidden nodes
** Feture detection (!!!)
   - Number of moves
   - How far pieces forward
** Performance measuring
   1. Get good data mapped to good outputs
   2. Training!!
      - Dotimes 10:
        + Select 10% of the training data and set it aside
        + Train with remaining 90% of data
        + Validate with remaining 10%
      - Average results
   3. Compare results with this network to other configurations

** Notes
   - look into having a "bias" node
   - look into getting "Neural Smithing" by Russell D. Reed and Robert
     J. Marks II

** Ideas
   - I could make the neural network's sole purpose to sort moves. To
     do this I'll supply it with a list of features of the board. It
     should then tell me (roughly) how good a move is. The stronger
     the yes, then the sooner it is searched.
